Building upon the existing repository in Front-End-Development

These files & coding exercises build upon the repository front-end-development, in which I mostly focused on learning the HTML5, CSS3 and JS syntax. This repository will focus on the following:

- PhP framework Symfony
- Bootstrap
- JS frameworks
  - React
  - Vue
- Node.js
- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
